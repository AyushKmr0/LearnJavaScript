# JavaScript and Classes


## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects". It helps in structuring code in a way that models real-world entities, making it more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.


## Object

An object is a collection of properties (key-value pairs) and methods (functions associated with an object).


## Parts of OOP in JavaScript

JavaScript implements OOP principles using various techniques:

1. Object Literal:

Creating objects directly using curly braces {}.

2. Constructor Functions:

Functions used to create multiple instances of objects with similar properties and methods.

3. Prototypes:

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

4. Classes:

Introduced in ES6, classes are syntactic sugar over prototypes, providing a cleaner and more structured way to define object templates.- Instances(new, this)

5. Instances (new, this):

Instances are objects created using constructor functions or classes. The new keyword is used to create an instance, while this refers to the current instance.

## The Four Pillars of OOP

1. Abstraction:

Hiding unnecessary details from the user and exposing only essential information.

2. Encapsulation:

Wrapping data (properties) and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

3. Inheritance:

Creating new classes based on existing classes to reuse code and establish relationships between them.

4. Polymorphism:

The ability for objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
